# CPU Scheduling Visualizer

(https://0u5qfu.csb.app/)

## What is this project?

I built this tool to help visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms work, specifically First In First Out (FIFO) and Shortest Job First (SJF).
This website lets you choose between FIFO and SJF algorithms to visualize, allowing you to manually put in a processes's arrival time and duration.
After adding however many processes you want, you can run the specified scheduling algorithm, and the website will then display a list of the completed processes' along with their completion time, and a visualization of the processes in the order in which they are scheduled on the CPU based on that algorithm.

## How did I build this project?

I built this on CodeSandbox using React and CSS.
